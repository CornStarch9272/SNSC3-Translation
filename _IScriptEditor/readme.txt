Text Editor

Buttons:
Open Button opens file
Save saves it to your downloads folders
Toggle JP toggles whether the JP text is displayed.
Toggle Code toggles the visibility of the scripts code. That's more just for fun, you can't edit it.
Sp. Character list various special characters
About says random stuff about this program.

Functionality:

Active Speaker:
There is a Header above each text box noting who the active speaker is,
If it says NO SPEAKER, then it's either the narrator(extremely rare) or it's a character who is off screen.

Built-in text replacer:
typing ... turns it into the ellipses character
typing two spaces turns into the japanese space

Character Counter:
Each line in a text box has a max size of 216 pixels.
This box counts your remaining pixel space.

Error Checking:
The character count box will change color based on whether the text box has errors or not.
Green=No Errors
Red=Errors
Going over the pixel limit -  causes an error
Having over 3 consecutive rows of dialogue causes an error (Big text boxes can only have 1)

Create new text boxes of dialogue:
This is one of the big advantages of this text editor. If you can't fit
all of your text in 3 lines, hit "Enter" twice to leave a blank line.
Then you can continue for 3 more lines. This is kind of hard for me to explain in text.
Also this is only for dialogue. Don't do it when the "active speaker" is Menu Option or something.

Point of Program:
Simpler than editing XML files in some ways
We won't need to use a secondary program to copy all the text over to the IScripts from the XML files
